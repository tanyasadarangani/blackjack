<BlackJack>: Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. 
The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting). 
At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
Blackjack's precursor was twenty-one, a game of unknown origin
